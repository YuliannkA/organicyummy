Project Proposal: **“ We are what we eat!”**

  Every day every person in whole world makes 3-5 decisions in regards of food choice and that’s just  for a single person. What happens when that person has a family? Number of required  meal decisions increases! Even for the family of four – for example a mother (statistically more involved and responsibilities driven) – she has to make food intake decisions in amount  10-15 per day!  The bigger the family, the bigger amount of preferences or conditions have to be taken into consideration. Let’s say different family members have some food sensitivities like allergy or intolerance, by the way the rates of which have skyrocketed over the past decade or two.
  
  At the same time we all live in this incredibly fast moving pace life! And these decisions have to be made fast! Frankly to say – What percentage of world’s population have been food wise educated ?  Let’s face it! Ridiculously small!!! So, how easy is it for someone with lack of knowledge to make decisions and right choices? Tough!!! And with every aspect of life it becomes even tougher!  
No time to cook, no time to do a proper grocery shopping, no time to eat! How many times per week every single person misses the meal time? Probably roughly 80% of people (with easy access to food – not including poverty areas) can relate to this scenario.

  So, what people usually do? Tend to catch the less resistant flow! Some people do their research and try self educate, but still it takes a lot of time and courage AND ability to sort the tons of information! Again the small fraction of population able to do that! And they take the easiest way of dealing with that! – yes! – the cheaper and the faster one!  BUT! Everything comes with it’s cost! No wonder these medical bills are so high and healthcare is on high demand! Not to mention Obesity.
  
  _We are what we eat!_ Which means - what chemical components you put in – such chemical reaction and processes you get to affect and fill every tissue of the body with.  Moreover the food prices create even bigger pressure.  You can hear from all directions that clean eating is expensive!  But with some analysis it can turn out the opposite or similarly on the level with conventional lifestyle.
As a data driven person, with family responsibilities, I knew I had to break into it! And I did!

  Based on my bilingual ability and life experience I could derive way larger amount of data, especially since USA food regulations and quality are different from ones in other countries.
  
  In fact, analysis helped me personally to get rid of Migranes after 15 years of suffering.
  
  Now, would really love to put all the knowledge in numbers and be strategically meaningful.

## Let's take a look.
