As a matter of fact for proper digestion our stomach produces stomach juice.

And also it has Ph level. 

So here is the question: How many people ever think of the quality of their stomach juice before meal consumption? 
the answer - closest ever possible to zero!
Every time I asked anyone that question - every time I got the surprised face with forward question - what kind of riddle is that?

The truth is **for every group of food we need a certain quality of stomach juice** for it to process our food throughoutly, otherwise every piece goes to the intestines untreated and releases all sorts of toxins into our bloodstream as an outcome from putrefaction process. Rotten content builds up with time which leads to all sorts of diseases.

**By that reason some foods can not be mixed, just because either of them in the mix simply won't be treated with digestive juice for them be nutritionally usefull and turn into harmfull. _Even healthy foods can be harmfull by the same reason!_**
