Considering that on average a person has at least 2 snacks a day, it makes it about 250 undesired calories intake at least. With the closer look to the common snacks ingredients, the sense behind snack will be literally lost as we will find out that at least 75% of contents is sugary and simple carbohydrates substances which basically transform into bodyfat with riuned digestion as side effect. 

In regards of costs: the picture losts it's rainbow, as expected. on average $7 cost substitution across the snacks. Seems not so low at a first glance. But at the same time raises lots of questions! and the main of these - what was in those low cost snacks as ingredients? What makes them that cheap and is it worth then to be put in our digestive system then?
