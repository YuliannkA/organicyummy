Such project as this one intented to help large amounts of people to feel better. But of course Human Factor confronting overwhelming procedure takes it's toll.

`________________________________________________________________________________________________`
Once there was conducted an experiment.
Pretty large amount of people have gotten two types of flyers, one person could have just either one of those. 
One type of flyers asked for help to large population of people and another one to just one little girl. At the end of the day a little girl's funds were overfilled by donations, but the big population's fund was nearly empty. 
After that this large amount of people have found out that it has happened like that and instead of giving to large population's fund - they stopped any donations completely.
Turned out for private small cases people are more willing to help rather then help to the majority.

Still interesting to observe the results on small groups aswell:
